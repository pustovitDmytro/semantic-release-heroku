# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Help Ukraine
I woke up on my 26th birthday at 5 am from the blows of russian missiles. They attacked the city of Kyiv, where I live, as well as the cities in which my family and friends live. Now my country is a war zone. 

We fight for democratic values, freedom, for our future! Once again Ukrainians have to stand against evil, terror, against genocide. The outcome of this war will determine what path human history is taking from now on.

ðŸ’›ðŸ’™  Help Ukraine! We need your support! There are [dozen ways][ukr-link] to help us, just do it!

## Requirements
[![Platform Status][node-ver-test-badge]][node-ver-test-url]

To use library you need to have [node](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed in your machine:

* node `>=10`
* npm `>=6`

Package is [continuously tested][node-ver-test-url] on darwin, linux and win32 platforms. All active and maintenance [LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) node releases are supported.

This package is shipped as [semantic-release][sr-url] plugin, so you need to have semantic-release installed and configured.

## Installation

To install the library, run the following command:

```bash
  npm i --save-dev semantic-release-heroku
```

## Usage

The plugin can be configured in the semantic-release [configuration file][sr-config]:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "semantic-release-heroku"
  ]
}
```
This is a minimal usage sample with a default configuration. 
### Configuration

if needed, the configuration can be extended:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    ["semantic-release-heroku", {
      "name": "funny-app",
      "npmVersion": false,
      "tarballDir": "./dist"
    }]
  ]
}
```
Config attribute description:

| Option | Required | Type | Description | Default |
|----|---|---|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `name`          | no | ```string```  | Heroku application name.    | name from package.json |
| `npmVersion`    | no | ```boolean``` | Whether to update package.json and package-lock with new version value | ```false```, package.json won't be touched      |
| `tarballDir`    | no |  ```string```  | Path to directory, where you can keep generated tarball. | Tarball will be generated into os /tmp directory |
| `branches`      | no | ```array``` | The branches on which releases should happen. See details on [branches configuration](#branches). | -

### branches
semantic-release [allow to manage][sr-complex-workflows] and automate complex release workflows. You can vary plugin settings based on the target branch. Use the `branches` keyword for this:
 1. Skip specific branch from heroku deploy:
   ```json
    "branches": ["master", "next"],
    "plugins": [
        "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
        "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
        [ 
            "semantic-release-heroku", {
                "branches": ["master"]
            } 
        ]
    ]
   ```
   here semantic release will run both *master* and *next* branches, but `semantic-release-heroku` will skip the *next* branch. 
  
  2. Use different plugin settings for contrasting branches. You can override any setting on the branch level. See example for custom app names:
   ```json
   [ 
      "semantic-release-heroku", {
          "branches": [
            "master", 
            { "branch": "next", "name": "staging-app" }
          ],
          "name": "production-app",
          "npmVersion": true
      } 
   ]
   ```
   here for both *master* and *next* branches package.json version will be updated `("npmVersion": true)`. But Heroku apps will have different names (`staging-app` for *next* and `production-app` for *master* )

### Authentication

In order to publish stuff to Heroku, you should obtain the Heroku API token. The easiest way to achieve this is to open [profile page][h-profile] and reveal the API key.

If you already have an API key, add it as an environment variable:
```sh
  HEROKU_API_KEY='<uuid>'
```
